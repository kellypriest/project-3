## Dog Adoption Outcomes
<p> In this project we want to analyze the outcomes of dogs in shelters, in hopes to create a predictive model on the likilihood of a dog getting adopted. Using data from Austin Animal Center and Family Dogs New Life Dog Shelter, we can build a model that will predict a dog's outcome based off of their age, breed, color, and gender. The goal is to build this model and present it as a tool for shelters to use to assist in making intake decisions. Another goal is to have this be a universal database for shelters to enter their outcome data, so that the predictive model can become stronger over time. There is unexplored, but accessible adoption outcome data and this project will provide the database needed to fill this void.
<p> Our plan is to employ the use of pandas to clean our data, and then house the data in a MongoDB database. We will complement our data with graphical representation using Plotly and then will project our visualizations on an interactive webpage. As far as the mnacihne learning aspect, we have already identified our classification variables and can test them using different weights to provide the most accurate prediction via Scikit-Learn.
